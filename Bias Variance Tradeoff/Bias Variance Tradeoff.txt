#Understand and define bias

#irreducible errors(inherent uncertainty): is due to sa natural variability within a system
#reducible errors: more controllable and should be minimized to ensure higher accuracy

#Bias and variance are componenents of redicible error
#Reducing errors requires selecting models that have appropriate complexity and flexibility

#Bias: the calculated error du to systematic mistakes that lead to high or lower
#results when compared to actual values

#Prediction Bias: a value indicating how far apart the average of predictions is from the average
# of labels in the dataset
#(Prediction model is not deliberately included in a majority of model designs
#but its used as a measure to evaluate and tune the model)

-------------------------------------------------

#Understanding a define Variance
#Calculate 'variance' from average mean
#calculate by taking the difference between each number in the data set
# and the mean, then squaring the differemce to make them positive,
#and finally dividing the sum of the squares by the number of values

S^2 = E(x^i - x)^2/n - 1

#-High variance indicates that all values within a set are far from the mean and
#far from each other

#-A small variance indicated the opposite

#-A variance value of zero(0) indicates that all values within a set of numbers
#are identical

#-Every variance that isnt zero(0) is a positive number

#-A variance cannot be nagative. You cant have a negative value resulting from a
#square

#Higher variances may lead to more errors in values that model hasnt seen yet

-------------------------------------------------

#Describing the Bias/ Variance Tradeoff

#One goal of predictive modeling is to find the optimal 'sweet spot' in which we
#minimize our error(find the ideal balance of bias and variance)

#modify our model to increase or decrease complexity to find a model that 
#generalizes well on its training and testing dataset

-------------------------------------------------

#Defining different types of Biases

#Biases can be rectified in the data selection process as part of your EDA, data cleaning,
#and feature selection

#SELECTION BIAS:
#-Using groups of individuals, or data in a way that does not allow for proper randomization
#This may result in a sample that is not representative of a populace.
#-eg...
#Polling only induviduals who have access to a landline telephone in 2012. This democracy 
#may not be wholly representative of all voters in the US

#SURVIVORSHIP BIAS:
#-Where interpreting the results from induviduals who have survived a long process are included
#excluded
#-eg...
#During WW2 Abraham Wald took survivorship bias into his calculations when considering
#how to minimize bomber losses to enemy fire

#REFERENCY BIAS:
#-When preference for the most recent event is favored over historic events
#-eg...
#The final lawyers closing argument a jury hears before being dismissed to deliberate
