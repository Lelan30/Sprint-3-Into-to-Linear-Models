#In the previous objective we considered speeding might be a factor in
#total number of accidents in which a driver is involved so we added a
#variable to our regression model to test this out

#Our model says otherwise, look at the variable 'speeding'
#we can see that we have a pvalue of .47(47%)
#Since that pvale is lower than our critical value .050
#we CANT reject the statement that:
#There is NO relatioship between total accidents and speeding
#in conclusion speeding is NOT a big factor in accidents as we might have thought

#The RSquared variable was .727(73%) for variable(alcohol)
#when a second variable (speeding) was added, the adjusted RSquared went down
#These results would suggest that the speeding variable didnt help explain any
#additional variation in the target variable of (total)
#Therefor our interpretation of the Pvalue and the null hypotheses was correct
