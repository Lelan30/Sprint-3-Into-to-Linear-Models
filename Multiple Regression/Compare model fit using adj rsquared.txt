#we can see that alcohol explains 72.7% of the variance in total accidents
#when we add in speeding, the rsquared value increases to .730(73%)
#but the adj rsquared value decreases from 0.721 to 0.719
#Rsquared values tend to increase with the number of variables added, even if theyre not useful
#if rsquared doesnt increase significantly when we add the new variable(s)
#then the Adj rsquared value will decrease

#The DECREASE is what happened here
#We added speeding, and adjusted rsquared decreased
#That would imply speeding doesnt help explain the variance in the target variable
